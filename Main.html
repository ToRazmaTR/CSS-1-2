                <h2>The Magic of Glowing Creatures</h2>
                    <p>
                        Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? 
                        This cool trick is called bioluminescence. 
                        It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their 
                        bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s 
                        version of neon lights!
                    </p>
                        <h3>Here’s how it works:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</li>
                                <li>An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</li>
                                <li>Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li>Fireflies: They flash to talk to each other and attract mates</li>
                                <li>Deep-sea fish: They use it to scare predators or lure prey.</li>
                                <li>Fungi and plants: Some even glow to attract bugs or spread spores!</li>
